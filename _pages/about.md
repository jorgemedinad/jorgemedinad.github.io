Welcome! Iâ€™m a PhD Candidate in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Texas A&M University.

I am broadly interested in the evolutionary and ecological dynamics that shape parasite diversity.

Currently, I focus on insect-parasite systems, using gregarine protists and Orthoptera hosts (grasshoppers, katydids, crickets and allies) to investigate how evolutionary history, morphology, and ecology interact to shape their diversity.

My work integrates phylogenetics, phylogenomics, cophylogenetic analysis, morphology, and taxonomy to explore the diversity and evolution of these parasites.
